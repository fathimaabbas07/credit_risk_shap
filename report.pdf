1. Project Title
Interpretable Machine Learning: SHAP Value Analysis for Credit Risk Prediction

2. Objective
Explain the goal: predict credit default risk and interpret model decisions using SHAP for transparency in financial applications.

3. Dataset Description
Source: e.g., German Credit Dataset or Give Me Some Credit (Kaggle)

Size: number of rows and columns

Target variable: default or loan_status

Key features: age, income, credit amount, duration, etc.

4. Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Train-test split

Class imbalance strategy (e.g., class_weight='balanced' or SMOTE)

5. Model Development
Algorithm: Random Forest or Gradient Boosting

Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV

Evaluation metrics: AUC, F1-score, Precision, Recall

6. SHAP Analysis
Global SHAP summary plot: top features

Local SHAP force plots:

High-risk case

Low-risk case

Borderline case

Interpretation of each case

7. Comparison with Permutation Importance
Visual comparison

Differences in ranking

Insights from both methods

8. Sensitivity Analysis
Perturb top 2 features by +1 std

Observe change in predicted probabilities

Discuss impact and policy relevance

9. Results Summary
Include a table:

Metric	Value
AUC	0.84
F1	0.71
Precision	0.73
Recall	0.69
10. Final Insights & Recommendations
Which features drive risk

How SHAP helps explain decisions
